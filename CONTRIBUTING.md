# Contributing to Nimbella Demo Projects

You are here to help on Demo Projects? Awesome! We want you to know you are welcome and we look forward to your contributions. Please read the following sections in order to understand this project and the contribution process better.


### We welcome all contributions

Contributions come in many different forms, not just code. Here are some quick tips:
- **Improving project documentation**: If you found a typo, just make a pull request with the fix. If you are planning to write new documentation for a demo app, please [open an issue first](../../issues/new/choose). This gives us a chance to provide guidance when necessary.
- **Adding a new project**: Please get an [overview](https://nimbella.io/downloads/nim/nim.html#overview-of-nimbella-projects-actions-and-deployment) and follow the [project structure](https://nimbella.io/downloads/nim/nim.html#about-projects) appropriately.
- **Changing existing project**: Please open an appropriate [issue](../../issues/new/choose) describing your proposed change before you create a pull request. This ensures consensus and allows us to work together toward positive outcomes.
