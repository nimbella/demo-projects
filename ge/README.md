# Inspiration


35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy once said

> The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all.

The importance of free and easily accessible information can never be overestimated. With November round the corner, it's election time! 

Inspire your friends, family, and everyone you know to know more and vote in the 2020 Presidential Election by building, sharing or extending these election related APIs and App â€” backed by powerful serverless technology, these allow you to look up the representatives, polling places, early vote location, candidate data, and other election official information without the hassles of sign ups, auth keys or having to provision servers and worrying about hosting. 

From Roald Dahl's unforgettable words about social change 

> Somewhere inside of all of us is the power to change the world

to Thomas Jefferson's historic truisms 

> We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate

there's something to inspire just about every voter out there.

Lastly as Nanette L. Avery puts it

> "Talk is cheap, voting is free; take it to the polls."
